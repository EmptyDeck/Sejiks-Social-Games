This code is using the wrong votes data.
it should use "votes" not "finalvotes"


in answer.js the votes data is saved like this:
function saveVotes() {
    if (!inviteCode || !currentGame || !currentRound) {
        console.warn('필수 정보 누락: 투표 저장 실패');
        return;
    }

    const voteKey = `vote_${inviteCode}_game_${currentGame}_round_${currentRound}`;
    localStorage.setItem(voteKey, JSON.stringify(votes));
    console.log(`✅ 투표 저장됨: ${voteKey}`, votes);
}
as you can see, the data has invite code, current game, current round.
