## What is it?

A fun offline party game where players guess each other's secret numbers by listening to their answers!

## How to Play (Simple!)

### 1. Setup

-   **Host:** Open the game file, generate codes for players
-   **Players:** Enter your 4-letter code (like "ABCD")
-   **Everyone:** Gets a secret number from 1-10

### 2. Game Example

**Host announces:** "Category is **Movies**"

**Players respond:**

-   **Sarah (secret number: 3):** "The Emoji Movie" _(something she'd rate 3/10)_
-   **Mike (secret number: 8):** "Avengers" _(something he'd rate 8/10)_
-   **Lisa (secret number: 1):** "Cats" _(something she'd rate 1/10)_

**Everyone guesses:**

-   "I think Sarah had number 2!"
-   "Mike definitely had 8 or 9!"
-   "Lisa had to be 1 or 2!"

**Scoring:**

-   Correct guesses = +1 point
-   Someone guesses your number = +1 point for you
-   If EVERYONE guesses your number = you get 0 points _(keep it challenging!)_

### 3. Keep Playing!
