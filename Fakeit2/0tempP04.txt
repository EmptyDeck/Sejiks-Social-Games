voting file format:
I want to change how the voing data is stored.
row = 5 
row 1 is player id, row 2,3,4,5 are votes for each round. row 2 is round 1, row 3 is round 2, row 4 is round 3, row 5 is round 4. all votes data is -1 at start. if one round didnt get voted, it will be 0. if it got voted, it will be 1
col = player count
for example
{0,1,0,0,-1}
{1,0,1,0,-1}
{2,0,1,0,-1}
{3,0,0,1,-1}
