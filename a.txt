I want to make a program to make me memorise enlgish words. And this is how we are going to do it.

It has a list of words in enlgish , korean
it shows a english word. it reads it out in english. It uses a mic for me to say that word in korean. if I dont say the word in x seconds (default 5 seconds) 
after 5 seconds, it will show the korean word and read it out in korean. 
make it in python.
also make it have a visual effect that shows time is running out.

Now tell me a grasp idea how you will implement this program.
